# HotelReservationApp
Project: Application for a Hotel. Purpose: Reserve rooms in the hotel and keep track of them. More info in the README.

This applications purpose is to make the functionality of a Hotel Rezervation tool.
In this project you can see: 
-JAVA encapsulation respected
-the use of Lists and Sets
-the use of a sorting algorithm to sort the reservations alphabetically by name
-a data base created automatically(hotel.db) when the app is closed. This will ensure that the reservation that you make will not be 
lost.

The scenario taken into consideration is:
-1 Hotel
-10 Rooms
-Reservations can be made on every date but the Rooms nr are choose automatically (from 0 to 9).
-The app will be used from the receptionist perspective.
